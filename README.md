# heapsort-javascript-demo
Standalone animated demonstration of Heap Sort algorithm using HTML5 Canvas and Javascript.

This is a Javascript alone implementation of an animated demonstration of the Heap Sort algorithm. 

It is a standalone application that can run on any browser that supports Canvas.

The number of elements can be chosen from 8 to 15.

The initial values are randomized.

The animation speed can be changed interactively.

I closely followed the approach of Cormen described in his reference textbook.
